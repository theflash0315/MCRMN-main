   <h3>Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The cancerous cells can invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissue, including organs.

    Cancer sometimes begins in one part of the body before spreading to other areas. This process is known as metastasis.
    
    1 in 2 people will develop some form of cancer during their lifetime. In the UK, the 4 most common types of cancer are:</h3>

    <section><p>You are more likely to get <a data-crosslink-type="article" 
      href="https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm" data-metrics-link="">cancer</a> 
      as you get older. In fact, age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. More than nine out of 10 cancers are diagnosed in people 45 and older. Seniors older than 74 make up almost 28% of all new cancer cases.</p>
      <p>Researchers are not sure why this is so. It could be that the passing decades give your cells more time to turn faulty, or mutate, and grow into cancer. Or older age simply means you have been exposed to sunlight, cigarette smoke, chemicals, and other cancer-causing agents for longer.</p>

    <section> <p>An estimated 1.81 million people in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2020. About 606,000 people are expected to die from any type of cancer. Cancer death rates have improved steadily since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>About four out of 10 Americans will have cancer at some point in their lifetime.</p>

      <div><h2>Cases by Age Groups</h2><p>You can get cancer at any age, including as infants and toddlers. But cancer is mostly a disease of middle age and beyond. The median age at diagnosis is 66, meaning that half of all new cases are found before then and half are diagnosed later. </p>
      <p>The following is the share of diagnoses for all types of cancer in the U.S. by age groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Under 20:</strong> 1%</li>
        <li><strong>20-34:</strong> 3%</li>
        <li><strong>35-44:</strong> 5%</li>
        <li><strong>45-54:</strong> 14%</li>
        <li><strong>55-64:</strong> 24%</li>
        <li><strong>65-74:</strong> 25%</li>
        <li><strong>75-84:</strong> 20%</li>
        <li><strong>85 and over:</strong> 8%</li>

        <p><strong>In the United States in 2018, 1,708,921 new cancer cases were reported and 599,265 people died of cancer. For every 100,000 people, 436 new cancer cases were reported and 149 people died of cancer. 2018 is the latest year for which incidence data are available.</strong></p>
        <p>The <a href="/cancer/uscs/">United States Cancer Statistics</a> (USCS) are the official federal cancer statistics. They come from combined cancer registry data collected by CDC's <a href="/cancer/npcr/">National Program of Cancer Registries</a> and the National Cancer Institute's
